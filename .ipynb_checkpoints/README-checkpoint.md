## Applying a Gradient Free Sampling Based Approach For Training Deep Spiking Neural Networks

This project inspired by a paper by Rohun Tripathi and Bharat Singh called "RSO: A Gradient Free Sampling Based Approach For Training Deep Neural Networks". In it I aim to use the proposed optimisation method in order to analyse and train a spiking neural network.
